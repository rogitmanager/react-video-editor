founderNotes: >
  This initial release serves as a proof of concept for the React Video Editor.
  While the functionality is contained within a single component for simplicity
  and learning purposes, it successfully validates the core concept of creating
  a browser-based video editor. || This version is particularly valuable for
  developers who are new to video editing in React, as it demonstrates the
  fundamental concepts in a straightforward implementation. || The codebase is
  intentionally simplified and consolidated, making it easier to understand the
  basic principles. For production applications, we recommend using more recent
  versions that feature better architecture and component separation. However,
  this version remains an excellent starting point for learning and prototyping
  video editing functionality in React.
